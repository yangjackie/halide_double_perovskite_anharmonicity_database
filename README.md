# Room Temperature Dynamic Stability and Vibrational Anharmonicity Database for Halide Double Perovskites

This repository provides the raw data associated with the publication of 'Mapping the Room-Temperature Dynamic Stabilities of Inorganic Halide Double Perovskites' in Chem. Mater. (DOI:10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c01779). A set of Jupyter notebooks are also provided for analyzing and visualizing the data. These notebooks can be built with Binder (https://mybinder.org/) to start up a virtual environments for analyzing the data online.
